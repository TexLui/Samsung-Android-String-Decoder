# Samsung-Android-String-Decoder
Shows the algorithm used to 'hide' ascii strings in many Samsung Android binaries.

This sample shows how to decode such strings.

To decode your own strings you find inside any binary you would need to copy 
not only the encoded string but it's associated bitmask and mixer array.
